/*
In this example:

1. We declare a variable name of type string to store the user's input.
2. We use fmt. Println to display a prompt asking the user to enter their name.
3. We use fmt.Scan(&name) to read the user's input and store it in the name variable.
The & symbol is used to get the memory address of the variable for Scan to populate.
4. Finally, we use fmt. Printf to print a greeting with the user's name.

. Keep in mind that fmt. Scan reads until the first whitespace character, so if you want to
read a whole line, you might want to use bufio package's NewScanner or
ReadString functions for more complex scenarios.

/*
. bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin) creates a new buffered reader that reads from the
standard input (os. Stdin).
. reader. ReadString('\n') reads a line from the input until it encounters a newline
character ('\n'). This allows the program to read the entire line of input, including
spaces.
. The input is stored in the name variable, and any potential errors are handled.

Â· A buffered reader is a type of reader that reads data from an underlying source, such as
a file or standard input (keyboard), and stores that data in a buffer. The buffer is a
temporary storage area in memory. Buffered readers are commonly used to improve the
efficiency of input operations.
